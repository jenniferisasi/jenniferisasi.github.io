I appeared in the second episode of the new: *Who is ADHO? CoreDH*, together with Dr. Lorena Gauthereau. This initiative by the [Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations](https://adho.org/) to showcase and disseminate the work of DHers; from their site: 


> You can listen to and read interviews with representatives from ADHO’s Constituent Organizations: learn about our organizations, their major projects and challenges, as well as individual members’ research. This series was prepared by Erdal Ayan and Anna Sofia Lippolis (Communications Fellows) with Hannah L. Jacobs (Communications Officer).


It was a real pleasure to spend some time with Lorena, Anna Sofia and Erdal to chat more about the [Association for Computers and the Humanities](https://ach.org/), digital archives, data curation and digital tools for research in DH. You can [listen](https://adho.org/about/podcast/) to our session or [read the transcript](https://adho.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CoreDH_Episode02_Transcript.pdf). 

If you do, thanks for listening!
