In June 2019 I had the great honor to work closely with one of the Latin American Digital Initiatives' partner in El Salvador, el [Museo de la Palabra y la Imagen](http://museo.com.sv/es/). I was part of the group to initiate the digitization of an embroideries collection created by refugee women during the Salvadorial Civil War and that the museum is getting to collect now through collective repatriation efforst. 

Although I was there to train the museum's team on textile digitization practices and digital scholarship in the community, they taught me very valuable lessons on historical memory, community building and group effort.
