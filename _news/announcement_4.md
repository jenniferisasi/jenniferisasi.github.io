The Council for Library and Information Resources awarded the 2018-2020 cohort of postdoctoral fellows in data curation for Latin American and Caribbean Studies a microgrant that will allow them to organize and host a symposium that will center the voices of several archives in Latin America and the Caribbean in a forum to share strategies and areas of need. 

The project "Capacity Assessment of Latin American and Caribbean Partners: A Symposium about Open-Access, Technological Needs, and Institutional Sustainability" will take place on April 16 and 17 in Miami. To learn more, [visit the website of the event](https://lacclirsymposium2020.github.io).
