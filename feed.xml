Since we are going to be reading recent articles and they often mention past debates or issues, I wanted to give a quick preview of how we have all shaped DH to what it currently does.</p> <p>For students to learn about the last 10ish years or so of the digital humanities in, mostly, the United States, I assigned each of them one of the introductions to <em>Debates in Digital Humanities</em> from 2012 to 2023. They were then in charge of a brief discussion, so they identified a few keywords and ideas, and brought up questions. Let me summarize a bit per year:</p> <ul> <li>2012: “The Big Tent” metaphor was of course something that stood out but also the mention of the coding or not coding debate and move towards making and building; accessibility; Is DH saving the Humanities?; Twitter; turn to inclusivity; and the semi-public peer review of the book.</li> <li>2016: Move from “big tent” to an expanded field noting that the big tent metaphor itself seemed a bit US/Anglo-centric; the division of the articles; and the decentralization of DH acknowledging our influence on other fields and how other fields influence DH.</li> <li>2019: DH as vectors; a request for accountability and empathy in our practices; focus on the present times.</li> <li>2023: Focus on the moment to recalibrate the sense of the future, asking ourselves how DH matters beyond itself; social justice in DH; more collaboration with ethical implications.</li> </ul> <p>We had a wonderful conversation about all that they found interesting while they made connections from one year to another themselves. This navigation through the years gave them a good sense of where we are at now, the type of further readings we will cover in class during the semester and the care they have to show on their project(s). How are they going to “take action in the present” in drafting their project documentation? How can they apply these notions and methods in their home disciplines?</p> <p>In order for them to see the variety and diversity of approaches of DH to scholarship in the present moment, the following day we discussed <em>Programming Historian</em> and <em>Reviews in DH</em> as two resources in which they can see DH in action. They loved both journals! They had some questions about how the reviews are done in <em>Reviews</em>, which I kindly explained, and offered a few suggestions for <em>PH</em> after reading:</p> <ul> <li>Sichani A-M, Baker J, Afanador-Llach MJ and Walsh B, “Diversity and inclusion in digital scholarship and pedagogy: the case of The Programming Historian,” Insights, 2019, 32: 16, 1–6;</li> <li>Isasi et al. “A Model for Multilingual and Multicultural Digital Scholarship Methods Publishing: The Case of Programming Historian,” in Multilingual Digital Humanities ed. by L. Violla and P. Spence, Routledge, 2023: 17-30.</li> </ul> <p>In the following days, they have to search for project examples that are related to our readings and each student will chose and teach a workshop from <em>Programming Historian</em>, with a low-tech approach first.</p> <hr/> <p>Some food for thought for all of us, left by a student, more or less like this: “So how is everyone going to participate in DH and these debates and methods and practices if all these books (on <em>Debates</em>) are in English only?”</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="course"/><category term="course"/><category term="bibliography"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[a summary of a class discussing how DH has changed in the last ten years plus a showcase of methods and DH examples]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What is the goal of this DH course?</title><link href="https://jenniferisasi.github.io/blog/2025/my-DH-class-perspective/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What is the goal of this DH course?"/><published>2025-01-16T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-01-16T12:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jenniferisasi.github.io/blog/2025/my-DH-class-perspective</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jenniferisasi.github.io/blog/2025/my-DH-class-perspective/"><![CDATA[<p>Second class in the books, with more students! Even if it cut some of the time I had planned to use on the readings (more below), I decided to start with a repeat of the <a href="https://jenniferisasi.github.io/blog/2025/first-day-of-class/">“We Data” exercise</a> with the two new students that joined today, and had the two previous student guide the conversation around data. Once again one student had a harder time than the other in thinking about themselves in data, but that didn’t stop them from creating and sharing data with some thoughts and questions about it.</p> <p>After getting to know each other better, we switched to knowing the course better. I had assigned them two articles for today, with the request to annotate them in any way they find useful<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>:</p> <ul> <li>Dombrowski, Quinn. “Does Coding Matter for Doing Digital Humanities?” <em>The Bloomsbury Handbook to the Digital Humanities</em>, edited by James O’Sullivan, Bloomsbury Academic, 2022. <a href="https://doi.org/10.5040/9781350232143">https://doi.org/10.5040/9781350232143</a>.</li> <li>Walsh, Brandon. “The Three-Speed Problem in Digital Humanities Pedagogy” <em>What We Teach When We Teach DH</em>, edited by Brian Croxall, Diane K. Jakacki, University of Minnesota Press, 2023. https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/jj.1410591.21</li> </ul> <p>I led the conversation to model what a discussion can look like in this course, but also to see if they had already connected the readings to their personal experiences and to make sure that I made clear the purpose of the course: To learn about the importance of drafting a workflow and documentation about one own’s research, by learning with examples relevant to them, and kind of at their own pace; rather than learning programming or multiple tools and methods.</p> <p>Quinn’s article is fantastic for this purpose, specifically, I believe -and my students thought so too-, because it has clear examples of what a workflow is (Quinn, did you write the steps of my dissertation?) and makes an argument for documenting all the steps in said workflow for maintenance, re-use, and sustainability; without getting too much into detail. At the same time, they are very clear about where the argument is coming from (coding or not coding?). I added a few questions along the way to help them connect ideas with their work. For example, I asked: “If I requested it, could you tell me how the files in your computers are organized?” They all responded “yes I can!” but upon asking further, they all confessed that they had to figure how to do it themselves and will probably not work forever. With this, it kind of clicked that writing detailed documentation of those decisions would help them in the future, specially if they need to share files with someone else.</p> <p>Brandon’s article, on the other hand, gave me the perfect entryway to assuring them that</p> <ul> <li>we won’t do buttonology to learn tools for the shake of learning them <ul> <li>A student brought up how the article made her think differently about the worth of learning a tool first, then figuring out how to use it for research</li> </ul> </li> <li>we won’t run over content until all of us are on the same page <ul> <li>Collaboration and sharing knowledge and skills is necessary in DH so we will help each other</li> </ul> </li> <li>designing a workflow will be applicable to their own research and interests, so they can create documentation about something that is really going to help them this semester: MA thesis research, dissertation, a final paper in another class, a hobby!</li> </ul> <p>Overall, a great second day of class with good questions to start the course will clear expectations from everyone - and for me to give more thought about content for future class sessions. I am very grateful to Quinn and Brandon for crafting these two thoughtful articles that are very accessible to anyone who might come into DH without having heard much about it or not having a clear idea of what we do.</p> <p>Next day we are going to chat about how DH has changed over time and I look forward to that discussion.</p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>I am using Perusall for this collective, online annotation assignments because it is the one that is integrated in Canvas at my institution.

This semester I am teaching a Digital Humanities course for graduate students at PSU called “Foundations in DH”. In a series of blog-posts that I hope to write regularly and inspired by the writing of my friend <a href="https://walshbr.com">Dr. Walsh</a> I will share my experience and thoughts throughout the semester.</p> <p>The course, overly summarized, will prepare the student to create their own project workflows and document relevant pieces of it (data organization, dictionaries, management plans, context, timeline, budget if “needed”, etc.) while they get to explore the many possibilities of DH. Since it is the first time and I have a very tiny class, I am going to target the content to students’ interest as much a possible. For now that looks like: Data modeling and documentation, Latinx DH, Multilingual DH, digitale Geisteswissenschaften (DH in German), and GlobalDH. Yay!</p> <p>Today was the usual “introductions” day but with a twist, thanks to “<a href="https://walshbr.com/blog/we-data-an-icebreaking-activity/">We Data: An Icebreaking Activity</a>” by Brandon. We are sharing our experiences and I loved this idea for an icebreaker by creating/curating and then sharing information in the form of data. And I think my students loved it!</p> <p>Using a few guiding questions that prompt the identification, description, collection, analysis, and distribution of data, students shared a few facts about themselves: full name, country of origin, degree, year in grad school, pets, number of languages, religion, hobbies, fun facts, etc. They also chose to narrate the data, adding some context or clarification when needed.</p> <p>After learning about each other, we had a brief and general discussion of the activity using, again, Brandon’s questions:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>What is data?
What is it not?
What was hard?
What did you learn?
How did it feel to represent yourselves in this way?
</code></pre></div></div> <p>As I was expecting, I had both the “easy” and “hard” responses here. The student that is used to having to create datasets after interviews didn’t have a hard time putting together some information in this format. The student who is more accustomed to narrative formats was taken a bit by surprised when asked to “categorized” the information of the paragraph that one usually shares the first day of class. But both were happy with the learning process. At the same time, they didn’t dislike having to represent themselves in this way because it helped them focus more on the type of information they were going to share.</p> <p>None of the students thought much about sharing sensitive data and, although we all shared personal data, they thought they could share anything they chose to, regarding the class as a safe space to do so. This fact I believe will do for interesting conversations as we move on to reading about digital archival practices, data modeling or presenting data.</p> <p>I will definitely incorporate this activity in other teaching spaces, adapting it to the goal of the sessions (ie can I use it for a network analysis workshop?).</p> <p>As I like doing, I modeled the exercise with some of my own data as well, sharing it in narrative form and trying to contextualize the information in connection to the course.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: left">Name</th> <th style="text-align: left">Pronouns</th> <th style="text-align: left">Country of origin</th> <th style="text-align: left"># of languages</th> <th style="text-align: left">Languages</th> <th style="text-align: left">Years in the US</th> <th style="text-align: left">Degree</th> <th style="text-align: left">Graduation Year</th> <th style="text-align: left">Current Title(s)</th> <th style="text-align: left">Hobby #1</th> <th style="text-align: left">Hobby #2</th> <th style="text-align: left">Hobby #3</th> <th style="text-align: left">?</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">Jennifer Isasi</td> <td style="text-align: left">she/her/ella</td> <td style="text-align: left">Spain</td> <td style="text-align: left">3</td> <td style="text-align: left">Spanish, English, Basque</td> <td style="text-align: left">13</td> <td style="text-align: left">Hispanic Studies with DH</td> <td style="text-align: left">2017</td> <td style="text-align: left">Assistant Research Professor of Digital Scholarship and Director of the Digital Liberal Arts Research Initiative</td> <td style="text-align: left">Dancing</td> <td style="text-align: left">Stories</td> <td style="text-align: left">LEGO</td> <td style="text-align: left">?</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="course"/><category term="icebreaking"/><category term="course"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[a summary of a first day of class]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">a post with advanced image components</title><link href="https://jenniferisasi.github.io/blog/2024/advanced-images/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="a post with advanced image components"/><published>2024-01-27T11:46:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-01-27T11:46:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jenniferisasi.github.io/blog/2024/advanced-images</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jenniferisasi.github.io/blog/2024/advanced-images/"><![CDATA[<p>This is an example post with advanced image components.</p> <h2 id="image-slider">Image Slider</h2> <p>This is a simple image slider.

</code></pre></div></div> <p>Let’s break it down: this is possible thanks to <a href="https://github.com/red-data-tools/jekyll-jupyter-notebook">Jekyll Jupyter Notebook plugin</a> that allows you to embed jupyter notebooks in your posts. It basically calls <a href="https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#convert-html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jupyter nbconvert --to html</code></a> to convert the notebook to an html page and then includes it in the post. Since <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/markdown/">Kramdown</a> is the default Markdown renderer for Jekyll, we need to surround the call to the plugin with the <a href="https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#extensions">::nomarkdown</a> tag so that it stops processing this part with Kramdown and outputs the content as-is.</p> <p>The plugin takes as input the path to the notebook, but it assumes the file exists. If you want to check if the file exists before calling the plugin, you can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file_exists</code> filter. This avoids getting a 404 error from the plugin and ending up displaying the main page inside of it instead. If the file does not exist, you can output a message to the user. The code displayed above outputs the following:</p> <div class="jupyter-notebook" style="position: relative; width: 100%; margin: 0 auto;"> <div class="jupyter-notebook-iframe-container"> <iframe src="/assets/jupyter/blog.ipynb.html" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; border-style: none;" width="100%" height="100%" onload="this.parentElement.style.paddingBottom = (this.contentWindow.document.documentElement.scrollHeight + 10) + 'px'"></iframe> </div> </div> <p>Note that the jupyter notebook supports both light and dark themes.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="sample-posts"/><category term="formatting"/><category term="jupyter"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[an example of a blog post with jupyter notebook]]></summary></entry></feed>
